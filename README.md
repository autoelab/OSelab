# OSelab
Basically an overglorified code copy-paster for demonstrating our "teamwork" this semester.
There's no database of solutions for OS elab, so we're just gonna have to make one ourselves!

## How do I use it?

- Download the latest executable from the [Release](https://github.com/autoelab/OSelab/releases) tab of this repo.
- Run it. Login. Done.

## Patch Notes

- Things are a bit different this time around.
- There are no solutions for OS elab questions.
- This script will store any new solution it finds into its database.
- These solutions will then be used to solve that same question for everyone else.
- Even if one person solves a particular question, it will be solved for everyone.
- This also means that *at least one person needs to solve the problem* for the rest.
- Contribute to the database by adding new solutions!
- Report generator is broken at the moment. Will fix later if needed.
